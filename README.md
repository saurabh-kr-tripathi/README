# README

# Hello, I'm Saurabh Kumar Tripathi 
I am an MSc Physics student with a deep curiosity for understanding the fundamental 
laws that govern nature. My interests span multiple domains of physics, ranging from 
the behavior of subatomic particles to large-scale astrophysical phenomena.

##  Academic Interests
My primary areas of interest include:
• High Energy Physics  
• Particle Physics  
• Astrophysics  
• Atomic and Molecular Physics  

I am particularly fascinated by how theoretical principles and mathematical frameworks 
can describe, explain, and predict physical phenomena.

##  Computational Work
Alongside my theoretical studies, I enjoy exploring physics through computation.  
This profile includes work related to:

• Physics simulations  
• Numerical methods  
• Scientific computing  
• Academic exercises and projects  

Most of my computational work is carried out using Python.

##  Currently Learning
I am continuously working to deepen my understanding of:

• Computational Physics  
• Numerical Techniques  
• Mathematical Modelling  
• Research-oriented problem solving  

##  Purpose of This Profile

This GitHub profile serves as a space to document my learning journey, computational 
experiments, and explorations of physical systems using programming tools.
